The repositories in this directory will be used as [gitmodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitmodules) and imported into the main branches of the `downquark.templateCore.ProjectSqeleton` directory

> Git does not allow the .gitmodules file within a working tree to be a symbolic link, and will refuse to check out such a tree entry.

The following need to be:
- Relocated
  - [ ] downquark.templateCore.ProjectSqeleton/_sqeleton/qore/web/plugins/workers >> for cleanliness see webworkers below
- Created
  - [ ] https://github.com/mdn/dom-examples/tree/master/streams
  - [ ] https://github.com/mdn/dom-examples/tree/master/web-crypto
