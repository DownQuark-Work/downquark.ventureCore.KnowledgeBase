this will keep track of what scripts go to what resources and we will be able to bundle them as necesarry

eg. Landing resource would need
- ui controller
- _deno/
  - cell_auto
  - floodfill
  - corridor

Maze resource may have some overlap but wouldn't need it all
- this file is what would specify the exact files to bundle together to have a working app w/o extra bloat

1 dir per resource
- may be files per dir since bundles are a 1:1 match with files
  - files separated by GET PUT PATCH etc?

Bundle from this dir to ./_v1|2|etc


deno bundle -c deno.jsonc ./ui/controls.generators.ts ../js/rogue/generate.dungeon.bundle.js
