# Narrative

## ideas:
1. Decorated Tagged template literal to handle shape/flow/feel of generated text. e.g.
> Taking the same grouping of words. (_cloud_, _fire_, _food_) you can apply different logic behind the scenes to obtain completely different results.
> **Tagged Templates** define the category, **decorators** set the tone.
```
@happy
const charDesc = character`He ate ${food} in front of the ${fire} under the ${cloud}`
// decorator and tag transform the string
console.log(charDesc) // The delectable food, pulled fresh from the fire, gave a peaceful presence to day with no cloud in the sky

@angry @strong
const enemEncounter = enemy`The orc had ${fire}, called us ${food}, and <CHARACTER> was wrapped in a ${cloud}`
console.log(enemEncounter) // Bellowing from hunger, the orc hurled a stick of ${fire} at <CHARACTER>, who was to be his ${food}, a ${cloud} of dust settled as it impacted and shook the wall.

// ...etc
```
