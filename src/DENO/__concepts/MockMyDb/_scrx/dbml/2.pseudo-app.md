## Pseudo-App has the folowing:

Logic Points:
- if value can be `NULL`, at least one will be

Friends:
- Users can
  - post:
    - on all first level
    - on any second level
      - _UNLESS_ a frenemy of the POSTER is a first or second level friend of the POSTEE

Comments:
- Revisions will be converted to `COUNT(UUID)` and only show the amount of times comment was edited with nothing else available

`AggregateDB.Acquiantances`:
> New table
> > - Humanimal UUID
> > - array of human names _OR_ name and type of pet
> > - array of frenemies -> User UUID if PK is User, Pet UUID if PK is pet

UUID|Array<USER_NAME|Array<PET_TYPE,PET_NAME>>|UUID[]
-|-|-
1|[@mike,@linda]|[...UUID_OF_HUMAN_USERS]
2|[[lizard,steve],[cat,harrietta]]|[...UUID_OF_PETS_BELONGING_TO_FRENEMIES_OF_PET_OWNER]


## Key words
> Note: These should always be defined in the `note`.
> Syntax should always be [@RULE rule definition, callback, etc]
> - inline `@` rules will remove the entire line from the output mysql file
> - multiline `@` rules will only remove what is in between the square brackets

- `@INITIAL` _required_
> Table where mock insertion should begin.
