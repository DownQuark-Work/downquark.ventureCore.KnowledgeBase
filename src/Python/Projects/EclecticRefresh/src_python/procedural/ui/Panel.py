# def print_hierarchy(w, depth=0):
#     print('  '*depth + w.winfo_class() + ' w=' + str(w.winfo_width()) + ' h=' + str(w.winfo_height()) + ' x=' + str(w.winfo_x()) + ' y=' + str(w.winfo_y()))
#     for i in w.winfo_children():
#         print_hierarchy(i, depth+1)
# ```
# The following are some of the most useful methods:
#
# winfo_class: a class identifying the type of widget, e.g., TButton for a themed button
# winfo_children: a list of widgets that are the direct children of a widget in the hierarchy
# winfo_parent: parent of the widget in the hierarchy
# winfo_toplevel: the toplevel window containing this widget
# winfo_width, winfo_height: current width and height of the widget; not accurate until it appears onscreen
# winfo_reqwidth, winfo_reqheight: the width and height that the widget requests of the geometry manager (more on this shortly)
# winfo_x, winfo_y: the position of the top-left corner of the widget relative to its parent
# winfo_rootx, winfo_rooty: the position of the top-left corner of the widget relative to the entire screen
